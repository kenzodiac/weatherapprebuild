- "Weather App Rebuild"
- This is an assignment where we rebuild our previous Weather App in react
- Isaiah Ferguson Peer Review: "Ken's overall design is amazing the use of colored Icons was excellent. The attention to detail with the current time and changing background themes based on weather conditions is an awesome touch. the responsiveness is excellent. The design for the mobile is nice however the search bar being in hidden in the hamburger might be a bit confusing. Unfortunately the favorites button isn't functioning. The footer at the bottom of the page is an very well done. the code is clean and easy to read, with great use of comments to section off code. Kens use of switch statements was really refreshing to see and easy to follow. overall an amazing job!"
